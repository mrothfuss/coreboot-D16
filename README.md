# This project has moved
Development of coreboot for the KGPE-D16 and related 15h motherboards has moved to [15h.org](https://15h.org). The associated git repository can be found [here](https://git.15h.org/mrothfuss/coreboot-15h).

# coreboot-D16

coreboot is a Free Software project aimed at replacing the proprietary BIOS
(firmware) found in most computers. coreboot performs a little bit of
hardware initialization and then executes additional boot logic, called a
payload.

This repository is dedicated to maintaining/building coreboot for the
ASUS KGPE-D16 motherboard, which has lost upstream support in coreboot
... and was never very stable to begin with (ie: boot stalls, runtime crashes, memory issues).

Information is also provided to assist others in building reliable firmware
for the D16 motherboard. The included files are configured to build a firmware
image without any closed-source components. Example commands are provided to customize the firmware
and include various closed-source components. The coreboot-4.11 version is recommended, fan control
in the tested coreboot-4.15 version is unreliable and may lead to harmful CPU temperatures.

Development of coreboot 4.11 and 4.15 by [mrothfuss](https://github.com/mrothfuss) has ceased. Work
on coreboot for AMD Fam15h has moved to [coreboot-fam15](https://github.com/mrothfuss/coreboot-fam15),
but currently does not support the ASUS motherboards. Initial configs for ASUS KGPE-D16 and KCMA-D8
have been created and are bootable with debugging output, but should only be considered by programmers
interested in working on firmware for these boards. This separate codebase uses source code provided by
AMD (AGESA) and performs better than the code developed by Raptor Engineering or Dasharo.

## coreboot-4.11

### Status

Missing Features: no fan control (can be provided by OpenBMC/fand or linux/fancontrol)

Consistency: the boot process is reliable (1000+ boots with no hangs/issues)

Stability: can crash under very high load

Issues: stability

### Build Environment

Debian 9 or 10 (amd64)

```bash
apt-get install -y bison build-essential curl flex git gnat libncurses5-dev m4 zlib1g-dev acpica-tools libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
```

### Codebase

* [coreboot-4.11 source code](https://www.coreboot.org/downloads.html).
* The mainboard specific code was originally developed by [Raptor Engineering](https://www.raptorengineering.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php).
* A few patches were developed here to fix bugs and improve stability.

## coreboot-4.15

### Status

Missing Features: bootsplash support with dedicated graphics

Consistency: the boot process is reliable (160+ boots with no hangs/issues)

Stability: can crash under very high load

Issues: stability, native fancontrol can fail to adapt to higher temperatures, GPU support is incomplete

### Build Environment

Debian 11 (amd64)

```bash
apt-get install -y bison build-essential curl flex git gnat libncurses5-dev m4 zlib1g-dev
```

### Codebase

* [coreboot-4.15 source code](https://www.coreboot.org/downloads.html).
* The mainboard specific code is in development by [Dasharo / 3mdeb](https://docs.dasharo.com/variants/asus_kgpe_d16/releases/), which includes both new code and reworked code previously developed by [Raptor Engineering](https://www.raptorengineering.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php).
* A few patches were developed here to fix bugs and improve stability. All patches developed here have been merged into Dasharo's upstream codebase.

## Building coreboot

```bash
### switch to the desired version
# cd coreboot-D16/coreboot-4.11

### build the cross compiler
make crossgcc-i386 CPUS=$(nproc)

### configure the firmware (optional)
# make menuconfig

### build the coreboot rom
make
```

## Fetching blobs

```bash
# cd coreboot-D16

### CPU Microcode
mkdir -p blobs/amd && cd blobs/amd
curl -O "https://httpredir.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/a/amd64-microcode/amd64-microcode_3.20191218.1.tar.xz"
tar xf amd64-microcode_3.20191218.1.tar.xz
cd ../../

### ASUS VGABIOS
mkdir -p blobs/asus && cd blobs/asus
curl -O "https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/SocketG34(1944)/KGPE-D16/BIOS/KGPE-D16-ASUS-3309.zip"
unzip KGPE-D16-ASUS-3309.zip
dd if=./KGPE-D16-ASUS-3309.ROM of=./vgabios.bin bs=1024 skip=1856 count=32
cd ../../
```

## Configuring the ROM

```bash
### switch to the desired version
# cd coreboot-D16/coreboot-4.11

# copy the base firmware image for modification
cp ./build/coreboot.rom ./

# set SeaBIOS option ROM settings
# 0 = no roms, 1 = VGA only, 2 = all roms (default)
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom add-int -i 1 -n etc/pci-optionrom-exec

# set SeaBIOS boot menu wait time (ms)
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom add-int -i 10000 -n etc/boot-menu-wait

# add AMD microcode
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom add -n microcode_amd.bin -f ../blobs/amd/amd64-microcode-3.20191218.1/microcode_amd.bin -t microcode
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom add -n microcode_amd_fam15h.bin -f ../blobs/amd/amd64-microcode-3.20191218.1/microcode_amd_fam15h.bin -t microcode

# replace SeaVGABIOS with ASUS VGABIOS
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom remove -n vgaroms/seavgabios.bin
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom add -n pci1a03,2000.rom -f ../blobs/asus/vgabios.bin -t optionrom

# add coreboot bootsplash (requires ASUS VGABIOS)
./build/cbfstool coreboot.rom add -n bootsplash.jpg -f ../blobs/coreboot/bootsplash_fs.jpg -t bootsplash

```
